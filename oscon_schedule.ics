SUMMARY:Node.js in Production: Postmortem Debugging and Performance Anal
 ysis
DESCRIPTION:Presented by David Pacheco (Joyent). While dynamic languages
  are extremely popular for rapid development, they're notoriously diffic

 as already developed sophisticated tools for both postmortem and runtime
  analysis that exceed those of many popular languages. We will discuss o
 ur work building and deploying such tools, including real-world producti
 on experiences.

SUMMARY:Digging into Open Data
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Kim Rees (Periscopic). Data, data everywhere, b
 ut not a structured bit. Open data is all the rage, but often this data 
 is poorly formatted or not very accessible. This session will discuss va
 rious ways to pry open the oyster of public data.

SUMMARY:Google Government Public Data: Finding and delivering the world’
 s government, tabular data
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Christopher Swenson (Google). The web consists 
 of free-form links, and Google has excelled at quickly searching through
  this information. But, finding structured data, such as databases, spre
 adsheets, and tables is hard: they contain few links into and out of the
 se documents. This talk discusses some of our efforts to find and presen
 t this data (focusing on government-generated), making it universally ac
 cessible and useful.

SUMMARY:Optimizing MySQL Configuration
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Peter Zaitsev (Percona Inc). MySQL's configurat
 ion file is often the focus of too much attention, and too much tweaking
  of variables that make no difference -- or worse, have the potential to
  negatively impact performance. The sample default configuration files t
 hat come with MySQL are unfortunately not very helpful or good, either. 
  We'll looking in creating a better one in this session.

SUMMARY:Concurrent Programming Using The Disruptor
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Trisha Gee (LMAX). The Disruptor is an open sou

 .  While it’s fashionable to use languages to hide away multithreading, 
 the Disruptor does the opposite - enables developers to parallelize thei
 r architecture easily. In this session, Trisha Gee will show how to use 
 the Disruptor, proving that concurrent programming doesn't have to be co
 mplicated.

SUMMARY:Reducing Technical Debt in OpenJDK -- The Legacy and the Burden
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Stuart Marks (Oracle). Like many projects, Open
 JDK has technical debt. OpenJDK, being an implementation of the Java pla
 tform, bears a greater burden: evolving the platform makes its own imple
 mentation go out of date. It's an enormous effort to keep the JDK up to 
 date with Java. This talk examines this kind of technical debt in OpenJD
 K and presents some paths toward mitigating it.

SUMMARY:Designing Hypermedia APIs
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Steve Klabnik (Jumpstart Lab). In this talk, St

 web and HTTP. Just as there's an impedance mismatch between our database
 s, our ORMs, and our models, there's an equal mismatch between our appli
 cations, our APIs, and our clients. Pros and cons of this approach will 
 be discussed, as well as why more people aren't building APIs this way y

 me services to a large number of concurrent connections from web browser
 s, and web API clients. Distributed systems are common. The fine grained
  concurrency, message oriented programming model and transparent distrib
 ution capabilities make Erlang well suited for these types of systems. C

 ed mostly unchanged for many years. Djenesis decouples bootstrapping fro
 m Django while allowing a user to choose their template or setup an exis
 ting project. Just as important, it also sets beginners up with a smooth
 er learning-curve and simplifies environmental setup.

SUMMARY:Moving from Apps to Services
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Craig Kerstiens (Heroku). Django's unique app s
 tructure enables developers to break their application into functional u
 nits from the start of a project. The next step is to move from many Dja
 ngo apps in a single project to many services that talk across defined c
 ontracts and API's. We'll walk through practices for doing this and how 
 Django enables it easily, but also the places it introduces complexities
 .

SUMMARY:Open Sourcing User Experience Design
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Jeff Gothelf (Proof). Design is often perceived
  as “making things user-friendly.” To combat that oversimplification, de
 signers shroud their work in specialized tools & jargon. This gives desi
 gners a false sense of value & control over their work. In actuality, th
 is drives divisions between designers & their teams. By open sourcing de
 sign process via transparency, the true value of Design and designers be
 comes clear.

SUMMARY:The Art of Organizational Manipulation
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Brian Fitzpatrick (Google, Inc.), Ben Collins-S
 ussman (Google, Inc.). We often hear engineers lament how hard it is to 
 get anything done inside of a big company. The trick to overcoming this 
 is to know the right people, understand how power flows in the organizat

SUMMARY:A Stitch In Time Saves Nine: Solving the N+1 Problem
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Paul Jones (http://paul-m-jones.com/). When dea
 ling with databases, developers frequently run into the N+1 problem, in 
 which they populate domain objects via queries in loops. This causes ter

 plain PHP as well as Postgres. It concludes with a way of automating the
  PHP side, and includes editorializing about the origins of the N+1 prob
 lem in the developer mindset.

SUMMARY:Frequently Asked and Infrequently Answered Questions  About Soft
 ware Patents
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Mishi Choudhary (Software Freedom Law Center), 
 Deb Nicholson (Open Invention Network), Justin Colannino (Ropes & Gray L
 LP). The intense commercial competition between technology companies is 
 driving large volumes of complex and often multi-jurisdictional patent l
 itigation.  With the de facto possibility of patenting software related 
 ideas in various countries, free and open source software developers mus
 t understand the patent risks inherent in the development and distributi
 on of their software.

SUMMARY:Bringing the Open Source to the Enterprise! An incomplete story
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Mohamed Elmallah (Children's Hospital of Los An
 geles). You have been there before, wondering why do we pay all this mon
 ey in licensing while we can go Open Source. You work for government, no
 n-profit, healthcare, or an IT consulting company, you propose Open Sour
 ce, but you find objections. If you are lucky enough to get an Open Sour
 ce project going, you meet resistance and many challenges. Well, you are
  not alone. Let's contemplate on few stories.

SUMMARY:US Patriot Act and implications for Cloud Computing & Data Priva
 cy
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Diane Mueller (ActiveState). Companies are thin
 king long & hard about legal & regulatory implications of cloud computin
 g. No matter what efficiency gains are, Legal often directs IT to steer 
 clear of any service that eliminates their ability to keep sensitive inf
 ormation out of the hands of Federal prosecutors. As the fog clears on t
 he US Patriot Act, best practices are emerging to enable corporations to
  move to the cloud.

 h now serve as “information inputs”, how we exchange ideas and even disc
 over knowledge. Yet despite the pieces being there, changing practice is
