SUMMARY:Node.js in Production: Postmortem Debugging and Performance Anal
 ysis
DESCRIPTION:Presented by David Pacheco (Joyent). While dynamic languages
  are extremely popular for rapid development, they're notoriously diffic

SUMMARY:Digging into Open Data
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Kim Rees (Periscopic). Data, data everywhere, b
 ut not a structured bit. Open data is all the rage, but often this data 
 is poorly formatted or not very accessible. This session will discuss va
 rious ways to pry open the oyster of public data.

SUMMARY:Google Government Public Data: Finding and delivering the world’
 s government, tabular data
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Christopher Swenson (Google). The web consists 
 of free-form links, and Google has excelled at quickly searching through
  this information. But, finding structured data, such as databases, spre
 adsheets, and tables is hard: they contain few links into and out of the
 se documents. This talk discusses some of our efforts to find and presen
 t this data (focusing on government-generated), making it universally ac
 cessible and useful.

SUMMARY:Optimizing MySQL Configuration
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Peter Zaitsev (Percona Inc). MySQL's configurat

  of variables that make no difference -- or worse, have the potential to
  negatively impact performance. The sample default configuration files t
 hat come with MySQL are unfortunately not very helpful or good, either. 
  We'll looking in creating a better one in this session.

DESCRIPTION:Presented by Trisha Gee (LMAX). The Disruptor is an open sou

 .  While it’s fashionable to use languages to hide away multithreading, 
 the Disruptor does the opposite - enables developers to parallelize thei
 r architecture easily. In this session, Trisha Gee will show how to use 
 the Disruptor, proving that concurrent programming doesn't have to be co
 mplicated.

SUMMARY:Reducing Technical Debt in OpenJDK -- The Legacy and the Burden
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Stuart Marks (Oracle). Like many projects, Open
 JDK has technical debt. OpenJDK, being an implementation of the Java pla
 tform, bears a greater burden: evolving the platform makes its own imple
 mentation go out of date. It's an enormous effort to keep the JDK up to 
 date with Java. This talk examines this kind of technical debt in OpenJD
 K and presents some paths toward mitigating it.

SUMMARY:Designing Hypermedia APIs
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Steve Klabnik (Jumpstart Lab). In this talk, St

 web and HTTP. Just as there's an impedance mismatch between our database
 s, our ORMs, and our models, there's an equal mismatch between our appli
 cations, our APIs, and our clients. Pros and cons of this approach will 
 be discussed, as well as why more people aren't building APIs this way y

DESCRIPTION:Presented by Loïc Hoguin (Nine Nines). Modern web services a
 re expected to be capable of providing realtime services to a large numb
 er of concurrent connections from web browsers, and web API clients. Dis
 tributed systems are common. The fine grained concurrency, message orien
 ted programming model and transparent distribution capabilities make Erl
 ang well suited for these types of systems. Cowboy brings Erlang's power

 ed mostly unchanged for many years. Djenesis decouples bootstrapping fro
 m Django while allowing a user to choose their template or setup an exis
 ting project. Just as important, it also sets beginners up with a smooth

SUMMARY:Moving from Apps to Services
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Craig Kerstiens (Heroku). Django's unique app s
 tructure enables developers to break their application into functional u
 nits from the start of a project. The next step is to move from many Dja
 ngo apps in a single project to many services that talk across defined c
 ontracts and API's. We'll walk through practices for doing this and how 
 Django enables it easily, but also the places it introduces complexities
 .

SUMMARY:Open Sourcing User Experience Design
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Jeff Gothelf (Proof). Design is often perceived
  as “making things user-friendly.” To combat that oversimplification, de
 signers shroud their work in specialized tools & jargon. This gives desi
 gners a false sense of value & control over their work. In actuality, th
 is drives divisions between designers & their teams. By open sourcing de
 sign process via transparency, the true value of Design and designers be
 comes clear.

  (Symantec). SDN is the promise of bringing comparable programmability t
 o the network by abstracting a logical view from the underlying infrastr
 ucture for more agility, flexibility, scalability but also for more inno
 vation, looking at networks in a new way and allowing for better synergi
 es with applications running on it. 2012 is poised to be a pivotal year 
 with production deployments, new players and more.

SUMMARY:A Look at The Network: Searching for Truth in Distributed Applic
 ations
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Scott Andreas (Boundary, Inc). This session exp
 lores the concept of the network as a source of truth for distributed ap
 plications and offers a deep-dive into higher-level problems that often 
 manifest early at level 3. Tying network and application behavior togeth
 er offers a powerful cocktail for finding and fixing problems in distrib
 uted applications quickly while also ensuring timely responses to client
 s spread across the net.

SUMMARY:Develop and Test Configuration Management Scripts with Vagrant
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Mitchell Hashimoto (Kiip). Whether you use Chef
 , Puppet, or just basic shell scripting, there seems to be no clear way 
 to incrementally develop and test scripts to provision a system. In this
  talk I'll introduce using local virtual machines managed by Vagrant as 
 a way to achieve this, shortening the feedback loop and increasing produ
 ctivity and confidence of configuration management script development.

DESCRIPTION:Presented by Steve Meyers (Utah Open Source Foundation). Mos
 t developers are developers, not DBAs, yet many smaller companies have i
 nadequate database experience in-house.  This is largely because databas
 es like MySQL and PostgreSQL don't necessarily require a full-time DBA t
 o administer.  It's become more important for developers at smaller comp
 anies to have some basic knowledge of how to keep their database happy.

SUMMARY:Big Little Boolean: The FERPA Restriction and You
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Michael Brewer (UGA: Franklin College OIT). One
  of the many parts of the FERPA law is the ability of students to put a

 nsequences of choosing the Restriction. In this session, we will discuss
  why you should add the field to your student records, why students opt 
 in, and what side effects can happen.

SUMMARY:How to Write Compilers and Optimizers (and solve Data Transforma
 tion Problems)
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Shevek . (Nebula). Compilers don't just turn C 
 into binary, they transform data, and the optimizer is a critical decisi
 on-maker in the process. If we understand both, we can often solve tedio
 us data transformation, scheduling or logic problems with very little ef
 fort. This presentation will teach you the magic, and convey a wealth of
  experience. Attendees have been known to subsequently write compilers.

 ransformed not only the way we approach modern day science, but a number
  of other facets of the research cycle: tools for analysis, mediums whic
 h now serve as “information inputs”, how we exchange ideas and even disc
 over knowledge. Yet despite the pieces being there, changing practice is
  like trying to shake a castle.

DESCRIPTION:Presented by Tim O'Reilly (O'Reilly Media, Inc.). Open sourc
 e software was one of the earliest successful examples of a sharing econ
 omy that has had huge economic impact. But as alternative energy advocat
 e Steve Baer once noted, ecosystem services are often ignored in economi
 c analysis: when you put your clothes in the dryer the energy you use is
  measured and counted, but when you hang them on the line, they disappea
 r from the measured economy.

SUMMARY:Mindware Upgrades For Fun And Profit
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Paul Fenwick (Perl Training Australia). Humans

 ether it's putting off healthy lifestyle choices, writing our tests and 
 documentation "tomorrow", or having just one more unit of something we k
 now we shouldn't. Learn how to patch your mindware, use cognitive prosth
 etics, and upgrade your memory to actually get done what you want to be 
 doing.
